# FlowStim

FlowStim is a personal project to build a lightweight fluids solver into an interactive application.

This project was inspired by the 'coding advanture' of [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE). In that case, the [Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) method was implemented with Unity and C# to create a multiphase fluid render.


### The Physics

The Finite-Volume Method is a mesh based approach to solving the momentum-conservation equationz for fluid flow. The domain is divided into a number of control volumes (Cells), which are connected through adjoining Faces.
