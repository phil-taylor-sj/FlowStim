# FlowStim

FlowStim is a personal project to build a lightweight fluids solver into an interactive application. The solver is implemented with the [Finite-Volume Method](https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Finite_volume) in C++, and utilises the Qt framework to implement the user interface. The ultimate goal is to build an application which can be deployed on Android/IOS, and allow the user to explore flow physics through a few, low-cost interactive test cases (and also learn more C++ along the way).

This project was inspired by the 'coding advanture' of [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE), in which the [Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) method was implemented with C# to create a multiphase fluid renderer Unity.

# The Physics

Whilst some background it provided here; the tutorial '12 Steps to Navier-Stokes' by [Lorena Barber](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/) is an excellent source for those unfamiliar with the general principles of Computational Fluid Dynamics. It provides a detailed step-by-step outline a basic solver implementation in Python, using the mesh-based [Finite-Difference Method](https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Finite_difference).

### Governing Equations

The momentum-conservation (Navier-Stokes) equations are the most critical governing equations in fluid mechanics. They relate the Advaction, Diffusion, Pressure and Source terms together. Although they cannot be solved directly, there are a wide array of numerical methods for discretising the euqations such that they can be solved iteratively. Collectively, these methods form the field fo Computational Fluid Mechanics.

### Finite-Volume Method

The Finite-Volume Method approaches this problem by first breaking down the singluar flow domain into many thousands/millions of control volumes (Cells). Together these volumes (Cells) form the mesh of the domain. This is in contrast to the meshless [SPH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) approach which aims to model fluid as a collection of particles in a continous domain. This is also in contrast to the mesh-based [Finite-Difference](https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Finite_difference) method, where the domain is represented by a series of discrete points.

# Structure

The code has been divided into two (actually three) libraries; one library for the numerical modelling code (Core), and one library for the graphical user interface (App). There is also a new library for a potential alternaitve to the current user interface; this is the AppQML library, which implements a GUI using the more modern QtQuick framework.

The following table outlines all libraries that are currentyl implemented.

| Application | Library | Features | Status
| --- |--- | --- | --- |
| Core | Domain | Builds and validates a mesh, which comprises of a collection of Cells, Faces, Verticies, and boundary sets, encapsulated within a Mesh class object. A MeshFactory class abstracts out all functionaltiy for Mesh class construction. | Full functionality for creating a 2d structured mesh. |
|  | Field | Constructs and manages all variable fields (i.e. velocity and pressure), for the domain. A 'FieldEquation' class encapsulates all cell center values and boundary conditions which must map to the Cells and boundaries in a corresponding Mesh class object. The 'FieldEquation' class also emcapsulates all discretisation schemes for a specific field, which are implements as components through composition | Fully functions for constructing 2D velocity fields with 1st and 2nd order spatial discretisation, and implicit temporal schemes. |
|  | Solver | Contains the algorithms (Solvers) for solving discretised fluid fields (FieldEquation). It also contains in-build point iteration methods for both explicit and implicit computations. | Currently functional for solving a dicretisation of [Burgers Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation#Complete_integral_of_the_inviscid_Burgers'_equation) (BurgersSolver), which represents a velocity field without the influence of pressure. Burger's equation is a non-physical test case, which is currently being used to test drive the GUI libraries. |
| App | App | Implements the GUI with the QtWidgets framework. | |
| AppQML | ApQML | Implements a modern cross-platform GUI with the QtQuick framwework | Still in the exploratory spiking phase. |



# Installation

The installation has been tested and verified with QtWidgets on MacOS.
To setup the code, Qt must be installed on the host system. All other dependencies will to automatically retrieved/installed by the Cmake build files. 

```
