# FlowStim

FlowStim is a personal project to build a lightweight fluids solver into an interactive application.

This project was inspired by the 'coding advanture' of [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE). In that case, the [Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) method was implemented with Unity and C# to create a multiphase fluid render.

For this project, the Finite-Volume methods is implemented in C++, and developed into an interactive application using the Qt framework.

### The Physics

## Governing Equations

The momentum-conservation (Navier-Stokes) equations are the most critical governing equations in fluid mechanics. They relate the Advaction, Diffusion, Pressure and Source terms together. Although they cannot be solved directly, there are a wide array of numerical methods for discretising the euqations such that they can be solved iteratively. Collectively, these methods form the field fo Computational Fluid Mechanics.

## Finite-Volume Method


The Finite-Volume Method is a mesh based approach to solving the momentum-conservation equationz for fluid flow. The domain is divided into a number of control volumes (Cells), which are connected through adjoining Faces.
