# FlowStim

FlowStim is a personal project to build a lightweight fluids solver into an interactive application. The solver is implemented with the [Finite-Volume Method](https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Finite_volume) in C++, and utilises the Qt framework to implement the user interface. The ultimate goal is to build an application which can be deployed on Android/IOS, and allow the user to explore flow physics through a few, low-cost interactive test cases (and also learn more C++ along the way).

This project was inspired by the 'coding advanture' of [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE), in which the [Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) method was implemented with C# to create a multiphase fluid renderer Unity.

### The Physics

Whilst some background it provided here; the tutorial '12 Steps to Navier-Stokes' by [Lorena Barber](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/) is an excellent source for those unfamiliar with the general principles of Computational Fluid Dynamics. It provides a detailed step-by-step outline a basic solver implementation in Python, using the mesh-based [Finite-Difference Method](https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Finite_difference).

## Governing Equations

The momentum-conservation (Navier-Stokes) equations are the most critical governing equations in fluid mechanics. They relate the Advaction, Diffusion, Pressure and Source terms together. Although they cannot be solved directly, there are a wide array of numerical methods for discretising the euqations such that they can be solved iteratively. Collectively, these methods form the field fo Computational Fluid Mechanics.

# Finite-Volume Method

The Finite-Volume Method approaches this problem by first breaking down the singluar flow domain into many thousands/millions of control volumes (Cells). Together these volumes (Cells) form the mesh of the domain. This is in contrast to the meshless [SPH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) approach which aims to model fluid as a collection of particles in a continous domain. This is also in contrast to the mesh-based [Finite-Difference](https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Finite_difference) method, where the domain is represented by a series of discrete points
